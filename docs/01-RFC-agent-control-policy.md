# Agent Control Policy (ACP) — Specification v0.4

*The policy language for the SIF gateway: the declarative file that decides, deterministically, what an AI agent is permitted to do, and what is recorded when it tries.*

> **Layering.** ACP is the upper layer. The lower layer — **what the agent can express** (the five action kinds and the intent shape) — is defined in the **SIF RFC** ([`00-RFC-sif-intent-format.md`](00-RFC-sif-intent-format.md)). ACP references SIF for the kinds and the operation shape; it does not redefine them. SIF = *what can be said*; ACP = *what is allowed*.

**Status:** Draft v0.4 (reference specification; supersedes v0.3). **Authors:** the agent-platform team.
**Audience:** engineers implementing or writing policies, and reviewers (security, compliance) who must read and certify them.

> **Compatibility:** v0.4 promotes the two deferred timing guarantees (decision freshness, scope no-race) from *documented boundary* to *specified behaviour* — **no policy-file syntax changed**; `schema/acp.schema.json` is unchanged and existing `apiVersion: acp/v0.1` policy files remain valid as-is. CS-017 adds gateway behaviour + deployment configuration; CS-018 adds a declared connector capability (connector metadata, additive). Deltas: v0.1 → v0.2 is `docs/RFC-changeset-v0.1-to-v0.2.md`; v0.2 → v0.3 is `docs/RFC-changeset-v0.2-to-v0.3.md`; v0.3 → v0.4 is `docs/RFC-changeset-v0.3-to-v0.4.md`.

## Changelog — v0.3 → v0.4

| ID | Type | §  | Summary |
|----|------|----|---------|
| CS-017 | ADDED | §12, §4.4 | **Decision freshness.** Every staged effect carries a finite decision **TTL** stamped at staging from gateway configuration (never policy syntax; short for `irreversible` effects); a row claimed past it settles `CANCELLED`/`stale-decision`, and a late approval does not resurrect it. Inside the dispatch claim — after the §9 kill re-check, before the connector call — the gateway re-validates the **volatile** gates (`allowlist`/`denylist`, `window`, `precondition`, `emissionControl`); a failure settles `CANCELLED`/`stale-guard:<gate>`, audited, never a partial dispatch. Non-volatile gates (counters, `valueLimit`/`contentCheck`, approvals) are **not** re-run. |
| CS-018 | ADDED | §6.3 | **Scope no-race.** Connectors declare a scope-reassertion capability, `transactional` \| `window`. A transactional connector re-asserts the scope predicate **inside the effect's own transaction** (zero rows affected ⇒ `FAILED`/`scope-lost`, audited — the write lands on authorized state or not at all). A window connector's target is re-resolved under scope immediately before dispatch, and its declared residual window is surfaced in the audit record. |

## Changelog — v0.2 → v0.3

| ID | Type | §  | Summary |
|----|------|----|---------|
| CS-010 | FIXED | §7.15, §14.3, §13 | `standing` cannot re-enable an explicit `deny` — deny always wins (§6.2). §14.3 wrongly listed `engage` under `deny` while a standing rule enabled it; corrected to rely on **default**-deny. New lint rule 11: an action in both `deny` and a `standing` rule's `enables` ⇒ **error** (the grant is unsatisfiable). |
| CS-011 | FIXED | §7.13 | `emissionControl` example syntax corrected to `{ checks: [...] }` — the previous `{ precondition: [...] }` spelling did not validate against `schema/acp.schema.json` (the fixtures already used `checks`). Also clarified when the gate resolves `hold` vs `fail`. |
| CS-012 | CLARIFIED | §6.1, §13 | Bare-name grant resolution defined: a bare token under a kind matches the **resource** of that name (all of that kind's actions on it) or **any declared action of that kind with that name**, on every resource that declares it. New lint rule 12: a bare action name in `allow` that resolves on more than one resource ⇒ **warn** (use the map form). A bare-name `deny` deliberately matches them all. |
| CS-013 | CHANGED | §8 | Grammar amendment: the right side of `in` / `not in` MAY be a function (e.g. `context.time in window("08:00-18:00")`), and string literals may be single- or double-quoted — legalising the form §7.15's example already used. No other operator/function change. |
| CS-014 | ADDED | §13 | New lint rule 13: `dualAuthorization` with an explicit `quorum` < 2 ⇒ **error** (contradicts the gate's definition, §7.9). |
| CS-015 | DOCS | — | Editorial: section numbering repaired (file structure is §3, kinds are §4; the `standing` row now points at §7.15); §4.3 lists all five `record` built-ins; §7 names the `Resource.action` gate-key form; §7.1's window note fixed; §14.1 gains `quota`/`spendLimit` and §14.5 `window`, so the worked examples now genuinely cover the full gate catalog; §14.3 aligned with its fixture. |
| CS-016 | CLARIFIED | §13 | Rule 1 (every referenced name exists) applies to **`deny` too** — the Registry spec's former "exception for `deny`" (doc 06 §8, undeclared names allowed in `deny`) is removed. A deny of an unknown name is a security no-op (default-deny already refuses unknowns) and almost always a typo; to pre-forbid a capability, **declare** the action in the registry and deny it. |

## Changelog — v0.1 → v0.2

| ID | Type | §  | Summary |
|----|------|----|---------|
| CS-001 | CLARIFIED | §6.3 | Scope means two things: a **filter** for reads/writes, a **pre-resolution authorization check** for effects. |
| CS-002 | CLARIFIED | §7.12 | `disclosure` has a **pre-check** (block before execute, sensitivity known from registry) and a **post-check** (withhold on return, row-dependent) form. |
| CS-003 | CHANGED | §4.4 | Effects are **staged (accepted/pending) by default**; inline execution is opt-in for cancellable effects only. Staging is the substrate for approvals and kill. (`SHOULD` → `MUST`.) |
| CS-004 | ADDED | §9 | Kill **no-race guarantee**: dispatch-time kill check and the `pending → dispatching` transition occur in one serialised transaction; three check points; idempotency key; explicit guarantee scope (prevents new/un-dispatched, cancels cancellable in-flight, compensates declared irreversibles, does **not** reverse committed effects). |
| CS-005 | ADDED | §8 | A condition path that is **absent/null at runtime** makes its gate **fail closed**, distinct from evaluating `false`. |
| CS-006 | ADDED | §11 | The audit write for an executed/settled effect **MUST share the transaction** with the state change (no effect-without-record, no record-without-effect). |
| CS-007 | ADDED | §9 | Kill **propagation** across gateway instances MUST be prompt and **self-healing** (fast notify + authoritative re-read); kill store unreachable ⇒ fail closed for irreversible effects. |
| CS-008 | ADDED | §13 | Linter MUST reject a `compensable` action whose registry entry declares no resolvable `compensation` — enforcing the §5 definition ("`compensable` = a declared undo exists"). Any declared `compensation` MUST name a resource+action that exists in the registry. |
| CS-009 | ADDED | §11 | Audit record gains `resultRefs` (a **list**): the downstream identifier(s) of an executed/settled effect's result (connector-returned id(s) of the created/changed record(s); plural because one action may fan out). The lineage/correlation key that makes an audited effect *locatable* so an external system can reconcile or compensate it. |

*One review item (interception-mode coverage: unmapped tools deny, free-form-string tools flagged) is a transport/architecture concern and lives in `docs/03-architecture-decisions.md`, not in this policy spec.*

### Conventions

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, and **MAY** are used as in RFC 2119. A *gateway* is the deterministic enforcement point; a *policy* is one ACP document governing one agent (or a reusable fragment). The *model registry* is the declared catalogue of resources and actions the gateway knows about; the policy references names from it.

---

## 1. Overview and design principles

An ACP document binds an **agent identity** to a set of **permissions** (what it may attempt) and **gates** (deterministic conditions every attempt must satisfy). The gateway evaluates the policy on every action; **no language model runs inside the evaluation**.

Five principles constrain the whole format. They are the reason the language stays small and certifiable.

1. **Default deny.** Anything not explicitly allowed is refused.
2. **Deny wins.** An explicit `deny` overrides any `allow`, always.
3. **Enforcement below the model.** Scope and gates are applied by the gateway after the agent acts; the agent never sees or supplies them.
4. **Deterministic gates only.** Every gate resolves to pass / fail / hold by code or a typed hook — never by model judgement. (A hook MAY call out, e.g. a DLP service, but returns a deterministic verdict.)
5. **Frozen shape.** The vocabulary of *kinds*, *gate types*, and *condition operators* is fixed. Growth happens by adding resources, actions, and named hooks — never new language constructs. (See §13.)

**Trust boundary.** The gateway proves that *intents conform to policy*; it does not prove that the code executing them does what it declares. Connectors, registered hooks, and the gateway itself are the trusted computing base: their integrity is a supply-chain property, mitigated by declaration (connector digest pinning, registry §5 of docs/06; a mismatch is a dependency failure under §10) and by deployment discipline — it is not established by this policy language. The non-normative discussion is in docs/13.

## 2. Core concepts

| Concept | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Agent** | The identity the policy governs (e.g. `support-assistant`). One policy per agent, possibly composed from fragments (§3.2). |
| **Actor** | The end principal on whose behalf the agent acts (the human user / session identity). Drives `scope` and approvals. |
| **Resource** | A thing the agent can act on or about — a record type, file, device, channel, sensor (e.g. `Customer`, `Vehicle`, `Email`). Declared in the model registry. |
| **Action** | A named operation of a given **kind** over a resource (e.g. `sendEmail`, `administer`, `engage`). Declared in the registry with its **governance attributes**. |
| **Kind** | One of five fixed categories every action belongs to (§4). |
| **Governance attributes** | Fixed, declared facts about an action that policies reason over: reversibility, emission, operative force, result sensitivity, explainability (§5). |
| **Gate** | A deterministic condition an attempted action must pass (§7). |
| **Decision** | The gateway's verdict: `allow`, `hold` (await approval), `deny`, or `halt`. |

---

## 3. File structure — top-level keys

### 3.1 Top-level keys

A policy document is YAML. Top-level keys:

| Key | Required | Purpose | Section |
|---|---|---|---|
| `apiVersion` | SHOULD | Spec version, e.g. `acp/v0.1`. | — |
| `agent` | **MUST** | The agent identity this policy governs. | §2 |
| `extends` | MAY | List of fragment policies to compose/inherit. | §3.2 |
| `defaults` | MAY | Document-wide defaults (`failureMode`, `audit`, `killable`). | §9–§11 |
| `allow` | **MUST** | Permissions: actions the agent MAY attempt, by kind. | §6 |
| `deny` | MAY | Explicit prohibitions; override `allow`. | §6 |
| `scope` | MAY | Per-resource scope predicates injected below the model. | §6.3 |
| `gates` | MAY | Deterministic conditions per action / kind / `'*'`. | §7 |
| `standing` | MAY | Time/quantity-conditioned authorizations (ROE, PRN). | §7.15 |
| `killable` | SHOULD | Whether the agent/its actions can be halted live. | §9 |
| `audit` | SHOULD | Audit level: `none` \| `basic` \| `full`. | §11 |

### 3.2 Composition (`extends`)
A policy MAY list fragments in `extends`; the gateway merges them in order, then applies this document last. Merge rules: `allow`/`deny`/`gates`/`scope` are **unioned**; on conflict, **`deny` always wins** and the **more restrictive** gate value wins (lower limit, narrower allowlist). Composition MUST NOT be able to *widen* a permission a fragment denied.

---

## 4. Action kinds — full enumeration

The five kinds are defined canonically in the **SIF RFC** ([`00-RFC-sif-intent-format.md`](00-RFC-sif-intent-format.md) §2); this section describes their **policy relevance** (which gates matter, where severity comes from). Every action belongs to **exactly one** of these five kinds. The kind is declared in the registry, not chosen by the policy or the agent. The kind shapes which gates are meaningful; it does **not**, by itself, determine severity (that comes from attributes, §5).

### 4.1 `observe` — acquire information, no change to the world
Reading a record, querying data, **passive** sensing, fetching a document. Returns data; changes nothing externally.
- **Primary risk:** disclosure / exfiltration. Reads can leak across tenants or classification levels.
- **Most relevant gates:** `scope`, `disclosure` (result sink), `allowlist`/`denylist`, `rate`, `requireApproval` (e.g. break-glass).
- **Note:** "just reading" is not automatically low-stakes (e.g. accessing a sealed medical record). And **active** sensing that *emits* (radar, sonar, a network probe) is **not** `observe` — it is `effect` (§4.4).

### 4.2 `assess` — produce a consequential judgement
Computing a decision, score, classification, or derived claim others rely on: a triage level, a risk score, a combat identification, a credit decision.
- **Primary risk:** a wrong/biased/unexplained decision that downstream actions trust.
- **Mandatory:** an `assess` action **MUST** declare its inputs and method; high-stakes `assess` **SHOULD** require explanation and/or human confirmation before any `effect` may rely on it.
- **Most relevant gates:** `requireExplanation`, `requireApproval` (`mode: confirm`), `dualAuthorization`, `disclosure`.

### 4.3 `record` — change facts the system owns
Create / update / delete / link / unlink stored data (the classic CRUD; the five built-ins of SIF §2), expressed as named actions.
- **Primary risk:** a record with **operative force** (a DNR, a target designation, a signed diagnosis) is mechanically a `record` but governs real consequences — gate it by its `operativeForce` attribute, not by the kind.
- **Most relevant gates:** `scope`, `precondition`, `valueLimit`, `requireApproval` (when `operativeForce == high`), `rate`/`quota`.

### 4.4 `effect` — cause a change in the external world
Send, dispatch, actuate, pay, drive, transmit — anything reaching beyond the system, **including emitting sensing** (radar/sonar/probe).
- **Primary risk:** irreversibility and blast radius. This is the kind the product exists to govern.
- **Most relevant gates:** all of them; especially `valueLimit`, `spendLimit`, `allowlist`, `precondition`, `contentCheck`, `requireApproval`, `dualAuthorization`, `window`, `quantityCap`, `emissionControl`.
- **Durability rule (CS-003):** because an `effect` cannot be transactionally rolled back, effects are **staged by default**. The gateway **MUST** record the intent and commit it (atomically with any `record` ops in the same batch), return an *accepted/pending* result, then dispatch asynchronously and represent the outcome as a `transition` (`pending → done / failed`) with a declared compensation where one exists. Inline (synchronous) execution is an explicit opt-in permitted **only** for cancellable effects. Staging is also the substrate for approvals (§7.8) and the kill-switch (§9).
- **Freshness rule (CS-017):** staging opens a decide→dispatch gap, so every staged action carries an **expiry (`expires_at`)** stamped at staging from gateway configuration — a decision TTL bounding how stale its decision may get before dispatch (§12). The default MUST be finite; for `irreversible` effects it SHOULD be short (minutes–hours, not days).

### 4.5 `transition` — advance a resource through its declared lifecycle
Move a thing from one declared state to another (`draft → signed`, `conflict_check → active`, `identified → designated`).
- **Primary risk:** performing a step out of order. The legal **from-states** are the institution's permitted process, declared once.
- **Mandatory:** a `transition` action **MUST** declare its legal `from` states; the gateway **MUST** refuse a transition whose current state is not in that set (this is a built-in `precondition`, not optional policy).
- **Most relevant gates:** `precondition` (from-states, built-in), `requireApproval`, `dualAuthorization`, `window`.

> **All five kinds appear, with gates, in the worked examples of §12.**

## 5. Governance attributes — full enumeration

Attributes are declared on each action in the registry and are **read-only** to the policy; conditions reference them (e.g. `when action.reversibility == irreversible`). They are how a policy applies severity uniformly without naming every action.

| Attribute | Allowed values | Meaning / typical use |
|---|---|---|
| `reversibility` | `reversible`, `compensable`, `irreversible` | The action's **terminal** recoverability — classify by its most-committed state; a pre-commit *cancellable* window is a runtime/connector property (§8.5, §9), not this attribute. Drives **recovery** controls only: the compensation mandate (`compensable` ⇒ a declared undo MUST exist, §13 rule 10), the fail-closed floor for `irreversible` (§10), and blast-radius warnings (§13.4). `compensable` = a *declared, in-system, gateway-routable* undo **action** exists (refund, discontinue, closeBreaker), distinct from the original — **not** an out-of-band procedure (backup-restore, clinical antidote); `reversible` = self-undo / inverse-data on the same action. **Not** the approval trigger — see the note below. |
| `emission` | `none`, `emits` | Whether the act reveals/transmits into the world even while "just looking." `emits` forces `observe`-looking sensing into `effect` handling. |
| `operativeForce` | `none`, `low`, `high` | Whether parties treat the result as authoritative and act on it (a DNR, a designation). |
| `resultSensitivity` | `public`, `internal`, `confidential`, `restricted`, or a domain classification label | Classification of data an `observe`/`assess` returns. Drives `disclosure`. |
| `explainability` | `none`, `required` | Whether the action (typically `assess`) must carry a recorded rationale. |

Domains MAY extend the *value sets* (e.g. add classification labels) but MUST NOT add new attribute *names*.

> **Note — reversibility ≠ stakes (orthogonal axes).** Reversibility is *recoverability*; it is **not** a proxy for "needs a human." Whether to **hold for approval** is a *stakes* decision and is per-instance: an internal "ticket updated" email and an email leaking PII to an outsider are equally `irreversible`, but only one needs a supervisor. Key approval on **stakes** — `operativeForce`, `resultSensitivity`, and conditions over `data.*` — not on `reversibility`. Gating approval on `action.reversibility == irreversible` *alone* over-gates low-stakes irreversibles (a sent email, a page) and under-thinks high-stakes *reversibles*; the worked example in §14.1 keys its approval on `operativeForce` for this reason. Two cautions: **reversible ≠ safe** — a reversible action can have irreversible *consequences* (a re-closed breaker doesn't restore the blackout; revoking a grant doesn't undo what leaked during the access window), so gate on the consequence's blast radius, not the action's recoverability; and **orthogonal ≠ uncorrelated** — high-stakes irreversibles are common (administer, purge, e-file), so the two axes are *determined separately*, not mutually exclusive. (Design rationale + the cross-domain refinements behind this note: `docs/03` → "Reversibility ≠ stakes".)

---

## 6. Authorization: `allow`, `deny`, `scope`

### 6.1 Syntax
`allow` and `deny` are maps keyed by **kind**, valued by a list of resources or named actions, or `'*'`.

```yaml
allow:
  - observe:    [Customer, Order, Invoice]     # any read of these resources
  - record:     [Note]                          # may create/update Notes
  - effect:     [sendEmail]                      # a specific named effect
  - transition: { Order: [confirm, ship] }       # named transitions on Order
deny:
  - effect:     [refund, exportData]             # never, regardless of allow
  - transition: { Order: [cancel] }
```

- A bare list under `observe` / `record` names **entities** — granting reads/writes of those entities (these kinds are implicit per entity; see the Registry spec §4).
- A bare list under `assess` / `effect` / `transition` names **declared actions** (each bound to an entity in the registry), e.g. `effect: [pay]`.
- A `{ Entity: [names] }` map grants only the **named** actions on that entity (works for any kind), e.g. `transition: { Invoice: [markPaid] }`.
- `'*'` as the value grants the whole kind (use sparingly; the linter warns).

**Bare-name resolution (CS-012).** A bare token under a kind matches either the **resource** of that name — granting *all* of that kind's actions on it, including explicitly declared ones (`observe: [Patient]` grants both the implicit `read` and a declared `readSealed`) — or **any declared action of that kind with that name**, on whichever resource declares it. Action names SHOULD therefore be unique per kind across the registry. If a name is declared by more than one resource, a bare-name `allow` grants it **everywhere it is declared** — the linter warns (§13 rule 12); use the `{ Entity: [names] }` map form to disambiguate. A bare-name `deny` deliberately matches every same-kind action with that name: a broad deny is the safe direction.

### 6.2 Precedence and defaults
The gateway MUST evaluate authorization as:

1. **Default `deny`.** No match ⇒ refused.
2. If any `deny` rule matches the action ⇒ **DENY** (deny always wins).
3. Else if any `allow` rule matches ⇒ proceed to scope and gates.
4. Among competing `allow` matches, the **most specific** (named action > resource > `'*'`) governs which gates apply.

### 6.3 `scope`
`scope` maps a resource to a **named scope predicate** resolved by the gateway from the actor's identity and **injected after the model**. The agent cannot read or set it.

```yaml
scope:
  Customer: assignedToCurrentUser     # only rows owned by the actor
  Matter:   clientOf(actor)
  Patient:  inWard(actor.ward)
  Track:    inCompartment(actor.clearance)
```

Scope predicates are declared/registered in the gateway (not free expressions). A scope on a resource applies to **every** kind touching it (an `observe`, a `record`, a `transition`). If a resource has a scope and the actor resolves to an empty set, matching actions return empty / are refused — never widened.

**Reads vs effects (CS-001).** For `observe`/`record`/`transition` that read or write owned data, the predicate is realised as a **filter** (e.g. an injected `WHERE` clause) applied by the connector below the gateway. For an `effect` — where there is nothing to "filter" — the same predicate is enforced as a **pre-resolution authorization check**: the gateway resolves the effect's target first, and if the target is not in the actor's scoped set the action is **DENIED before dispatch**. Either way the agent never supplies or sees its own scope.

**Scope no-race (CS-018).** The scope-on-effect check runs at decision time, and staging (§4.4) widens the check→commit window — so the authorizing state can change in between (an account reassigned to another tenant) and the effect would land on un-authorized state: a TOCTOU race. v0.4 closes it where it can be closed and prices it where it can't, keyed on a capability **each connector declares once** (connector metadata, additive — never policy syntax):

- **`transactional`** (SQL-class): the gateway MUST re-assert the scope predicate **inside the effect's own transaction** — mechanically, the predicate's constraint is ANDed into the effect's write (`UPDATE … WHERE id = :target AND tenant_id = :actor_tenant`). Zero rows affected ⇒ the effect settles `FAILED` with reason `scope-lost` (audited); the write commits against authorized state **or not at all**. This is the same shape as the kill no-race (§9): the check and the commit share one transaction.
- **`window`** (HTTP, email, device): the predicate cannot ride into the upstream's transaction, so the decision-time pre-check remains the guarantee. The gateway SHOULD re-resolve the target under scope **immediately before dispatch** (shrinking the window to connector latency; a vanished target settles `FAILED`/`scope-lost` with nothing sent), and the connector's **declared** residual window MUST be surfaced in the audit record — the residual risk is priced, not hidden.

This is not dispatch-time re-authorization: `allow`/`deny` and the scope *decision* are not re-derived; only the already-decided predicate is re-asserted against current state. Separately, **pure read staleness is out of scope**: the gateway guarantees scope/disclosure correctness *at read time*, not that the data stays current — and because every effect is re-authorized independently, a stale read cannot itself cause an unauthorized effect.

---

## 7. Gate catalog — full enumeration

Gates attach under `gates`, keyed by a **named action** (bare — `sendEmail` — or resource-qualified — `Order.confirm`), a **kind**, or `'*'` (all actions). All gates that match an action are combined with **AND** — every one MUST pass. Each gate resolves to `pass`, `fail` (⇒ DENY), or `hold` (⇒ await approval). Any gate value MAY be made conditional with `when:` (§8).

```yaml
gates:
  sendEmail:           # by named action
    rate: 20/hour
  effect:              # by kind (applies to all effects)
    spendLimit: 50/session
  '*':                 # global
    requireApproval: { when: "action.reversibility == irreversible" }
```

The complete gate set (unchanged in v0.2):

| # | Gate | Resolves | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `rate` | pass/fail | Frequency ceiling per window. |
| 2 | `quota` | pass/fail | Cumulative cap over window/session. |
| 3 | `valueLimit` | pass/fail | Numeric bound on a parameter/field. |
| 4 | `spendLimit` | pass/fail | Cost/$ ceiling per task/session. |
| 5 | `allowlist` / `denylist` | pass/fail | Membership constraint on a field. |
| 6 | `precondition` | pass/fail | Named deterministic check / lifecycle from-states. |
| 7 | `contentCheck` | pass/fail | Typed hook (DLP, PII, classification scan). |
| 8 | `requireApproval` | pass/hold | Human sign-off, optionally conditional. |
| 9 | `dualAuthorization` | pass/hold | Two distinct identities required. |
| 10 | `window` | pass/fail | Temporal allow (hours, date range). |
| 11 | `quantityCap` | pass/fail | Per-subject cumulative cap (e.g. per patient). |
| 12 | `disclosure` | pass/fail | Result classification ↔ allowed recipients/sinks (reads). |
| 13 | `emissionControl` | pass/hold | Deconfliction/authorization for emitting effects. |
| 14 | `requireExplanation` | pass/fail | Action must carry a recorded rationale (assess). |

### 7.1 `rate`
`N/window` where window ∈ `second|minute|hour|day`. (Duration-*valued* fields elsewhere — `requireApproval.timeout`, `quantityCap.window` — use the `Ns/Nm/Nh/Nd` shorthand instead; the two forms are not interchangeable.) Optional `per:` to scope the count.
```yaml
sendEmail:
  rate: 20/hour
  # or per-target:
charge:
  rate: { limit: 3/day, per: resource.customerId }
```

### 7.2 `quota`
Cumulative cap over a longer horizon or per session.
```yaml
exportReport:
  quota: 100/day
```

### 7.3 `valueLimit`
Bounds a numeric parameter. Supports `max`, `min`, or both.
```yaml
pay:
  valueLimit: { field: data.amount, max: 10000, currency: USD }
setSpeed:
  valueLimit: { field: data.kph, max: 130, min: 0 }
```

### 7.4 `spendLimit`
Cost ceiling for the agent's run; stops retry storms.
```yaml
effect:
  spendLimit: 25/session        # $ or token-cost units, gateway-configured
```

### 7.5 `allowlist` / `denylist`
Membership on a field. Lists MAY reference named sets (`allowlist:corporate-domains`).
```yaml
sendEmail:
  allowlist: { field: data.recipientDomain, set: corporate-domains }
eFile:
  allowlist: { field: data.court, set: approved-court-systems }
transferFunds:
  denylist:  { field: data.destinationCountry, set: sanctioned-list }
```

### 7.6 `precondition`
A named, registered deterministic check, or — for a `transition` — the legal `from` states (the latter is built in and MUST always hold).
```yaml
administer:
  precondition: [fiveRightsVerified, notDiscontinued]
Order.ship:
  precondition: { from: [packed] }          # transition from-states
engage:
  precondition: [positiveIdentification]
```

### 7.7 `contentCheck`
A typed hook returning pass/block. Hooks are registered code; the policy names one.
```yaml
sendEmail:
  contentCheck: dlp.basic
publish:
  contentCheck: [pii.scan, classification.scan]
```

### 7.8 `requireApproval`
Holds the action for a human. Fields: `when` (condition; default always), `approvers` (role or set), `quorum` (default 1), `timeout`, `onTimeout` (`deny` default | `allow`), `mode` (`approve` default | `confirm`).
```yaml
'*':
  requireApproval:
    when: "action.reversibility == irreversible"
    approvers: role:supervisor
    timeout: 30m
    onTimeout: deny
refund:
  requireApproval: { approvers: role:finance-manager }
```

### 7.9 `dualAuthorization`
Two **distinct** identities must approve (the actor cannot self-approve). Fields: `approvers`, `quorum: 2` implied, `distinctFrom: actor`.
```yaml
engage:
  dualAuthorization: { approvers: role:weapons-release-authority }
wireTransfer:
  dualAuthorization: { when: "data.amount > 50000", approvers: role:treasury }
```

### 7.10 `window`
Temporal allow. A match outside the window ⇒ fail.
```yaml
deploy:
  window: { days: [Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu], hours: "09:00-16:00", tz: "Europe/Bratislava" }
```

### 7.11 `quantityCap`
Per-subject cumulative cap over a window — the PRN/standing-order pattern.
```yaml
administer:
  quantityCap: { per: resource.patientId, limit: 3, window: 24h, of: data.drug }
```

### 7.12 `disclosure`
Binds the **result classification** of a read to permitted recipients/sinks. Prevents the exfiltration/spillage leg.
```yaml
observe:
  disclosure:
    when: "action.resultSensitivity == restricted"
    allowSink: [careTeam]                 # named sinks; default-deny others
readIntel:
  disclosure: { maxClassification: actor.clearance }
```
**Two forms (CS-002).** `disclosure` is enforced in whichever form the data allows: a **pre-check** when the result's sensitivity is known from the registry (the read is **blocked before execution**), and a **post-check** when sensitivity is row-dependent (the read executes, but a disallowed result is **withheld on return** and the decision recorded as `deny` with "result withheld"). The gateway MUST use the pre-check form whenever it can determine sensitivity without executing.

### 7.13 `emissionControl`
For `effect` actions with `emission == emits`: require deconfliction/authorization before the emission. Its value takes the same shape as `precondition` (`checks:` / `when:`).
```yaml
radarSweep:
  emissionControl: { checks: [emconAuthorized, deconflicted] }
```
A failed check resolves **fail** (⇒ DENY); the gate resolves **hold** only when the required authorization is a pending human/deconfliction decision rather than a failed deterministic check.

### 7.14 `requireExplanation`
For `assess`: the action MUST produce a recorded rationale (and SHOULD pair with `requireApproval: {mode: confirm}` when high-stakes).
```yaml
triage:
  requireExplanation: true
combatId:
  requireExplanation: true
  requireApproval: { mode: confirm, approvers: role:tactical-officer }
```

### 7.15 `standing` (top-level conditional authorizations)
`standing` declares grants that are *off by default* and switched on by context — ROE states, shift windows, PRN orders. They are evaluated as additional `allow` + gate conditions.

**Standing never overrides `deny` (CS-010).** A standing grant is a *conditional allow* and is subject to the §6.2 precedence unchanged: an explicit `deny` beats it, always. To make an action available *only* under a standing rule, leave it **out of `allow`** (default-deny covers the off state) and do **not** list it in `deny` — a policy that lists the same action in both `deny` and a `standing` rule's `enables` is unsatisfiable and MUST be rejected by the linter (§13 rule 11).
```yaml
standing:
  - name: weapons-free
    when: "context.roeState == 'weapons_free'"
    enables: { effect: [engage] }
  - name: clinic-hours-orders
    when: "context.time in window('08:00-18:00')"
    enables: { transition: { Order: [sign] } }
```

---

## 8. Condition expression language

Conditions (`when:`) are a **small, frozen** boolean language. No loops, no assignment, no arithmetic beyond comparison. Grammar (EBNF):

```
condition  := orExpr
orExpr     := andExpr ("or" andExpr)*
andExpr    := unary ("and" unary)*
unary      := "not" unary | comparison | "(" condition ")"
comparison := operand op operand
            | operand ("in" | "not in") (list | function)
            | "exists" path
op         := "==" | "!=" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">=" | "matches"
operand    := path | literal | function
path       := ident ("." ident)*
function   := ident "(" [ literal ("," literal)* ] ")"
literal    := string | number | boolean | duration | list
duration   := number ("s" | "m" | "h" | "d")
list       := "[" [ literal ("," literal)* ] "]"
```

**Reference namespaces** (read-only):

| Namespace | Examples | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `action.*` | `action.kind`, `action.name`, `action.resource`, `action.reversibility`, `action.emission`, `action.operativeForce`, `action.resultSensitivity`, `action.explainability` | The attempted action and its declared attributes. |
| `data.*` | `data.amount`, `data.recipientDomain`, `data.kph` | Parameters the agent supplied. |
| `resource.*` | `resource.patientId`, `resource.currentState`, `resource.ownerId` | Properties of the resolved target. |
| `actor.*` | `actor.id`, `actor.role`, `actor.clearance`, `actor.ward` | The principal the agent acts for. |
| `context.*` | `context.now`, `context.time`, `context.roeState`, `context.sessionSpend` | Ambient state. |

**Functions** (the complete set): `count(scope, window)`, `now()`, `window("HH:MM-HH:MM")`, `spend(window)`. No others.

String literals may be single- or double-quoted. The right side of `in` / `not in` is a list literal or a function returning a collection/range — `context.time in window("08:00-18:00")` (CS-013; this legalises the form §7.15's example already used).

**Runtime resolution (CS-005).** Unknown paths are rejected at policy load (§13.9). If a referenced path is **absent or null at runtime** (e.g. `resource.foo` is missing on the resolved target), the gate whose condition referenced it **fails closed** (resolves DENY) — this is distinct from the condition evaluating to `false`. A condition error MUST NOT silently pass a gate.

---

## 9. Kill-switch (`killable`)
`killable: true` (default SHOULD be true for non-trivial agents) lets an operator issue a `halt` that:
- stops in-flight actions for an **action class**, a **session**, or the **agent**;
- causes subsequent matched attempts to resolve `halt` (not `deny`) — a distinct, audited terminal state;
- is itself an audited operator action (who halted, when, scope) and is reversible (the order can be lifted).

**No-race guarantee (CS-004).** A `halt` MUST take effect before the connector dispatch of any pending `effect`. The gateway MUST evaluate the kill at three points — entry (whole-agent/session short-circuit), per-action (pipeline step 5), and **at dispatch**, where the kill re-check and the staged action's `pending → dispatching` transition MUST occur in **one serialised transaction** (e.g. a row-locked update) so there is no window in which an action has both passed the kill check and remains un-dispatched. Each staged action carries an **idempotency key** so a cancelled action can never later dispatch.

**Scope of the guarantee (CS-004).** Kill prevents any *new* or *not-yet-dispatched* action; cancels in-flight actions whose connector is cancellable; and triggers declared **compensation** for irreversible effects already dispatched. It does **not** reverse an external effect that has already committed — nor does it reach effects that a committed effect *triggers downstream* (world→world cascades, §11 scope boundary): kill bounds the agent's actions, not the world's reactions.

**Propagation (CS-007).** A kill MUST take effect across all gateway instances **promptly and reliably** — by fast notification (e.g. pub/sub) plus a self-healing authoritative re-read (e.g. an epoch counter) so a dropped notification cannot leave an instance unaware. If the kill store is unreachable, the gateway MUST **fail closed** for irreversible effects.

*Mechanism detail (state stores, the locked-transition transaction, in-flight cancellation) is in the implementation design §8.*

> **Clarification — two axes; `killable` is not an operator veto (UNDER REVIEW).** The wording above (*"`killable: true` … lets an operator issue a `halt`"*) reads as if `killable` gates the operator. It does not. There are **two independent axes**:
> 1. **Operator emergency hard-kill** — a human operator can **always** halt a scope (fleet/gateway/agent/session/action-class) immediately and resume after investigation. This is a hard safety/security backstop: it is **unconditional and independent of `killable`**, and a policy **cannot opt out** (otherwise a compromised agent could declare itself un-killable — and an operator can pull the process/credentials/network regardless, so an opt-out is a false guarantee).
> 2. **`killable`** — an action-level declaration of *the manner of stopping under normal/automated operation* (a generic live-freeze vs a declared safe-stop/compensation). It **informs but never blocks** the operator hard-kill (it drives a warning/confirmation when a hard-kill scope covers non-killable actions, and it guards *automated* halts).
>
> `killable` is also distinct from `reversibility`: `killable` = *may a generic live-halt stop this at all?*; `reversibility` = *how much can a kill claw back once it is in motion* (the "scope of the guarantee" above). The precise semantics, granularity, linter rule, and any reconciliation of the §9 wording are **open** — see `docs/03` → "Kill is two axes — operator hard-kill vs `killable`". Until they settle, treat the hard-kill as unconditional and `killable` as advisory.

---

## 10. Failure mode (`defaults.failureMode`)
If the gateway, a `contentCheck` hook, or a scope/approval dependency is **unavailable or errors** — or a connector fails its declared-digest check (docs/06 §5) — behavior is governed by `failureMode`:

```yaml
defaults:
  failureMode: closed        # closed (default) | open
```
- `closed` — the action is **denied** (regulated/safety default). MUST be the default.
- `open` — the action is allowed (only for low-stakes deployments).
`failureMode` MAY be overridden per kind/action; an `open` override on an `irreversible` action MUST be a linter error unless explicitly acknowledged.

---

## 11. Audit (`audit`)
Levels: `none` | `basic` (decisions only) | `full` (decisions + parameters + gate results). Regulated deployments SHOULD use `full`. Every evaluated action — **allowed, held, denied, or halted** — produces one append-only record. Required fields at `full`:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `id`, `timestamp` | Unique id and time. |
| `agent`, `actor` | Governing agent and the principal it acted for. |
| `kind`, `resource`, `action` | The attempted action. |
| `parameters` | Typed parameters supplied (subject to redaction policy). |
| `scopeApplied` | Scope predicate(s) injected. For a settled effect, also **which scope-reassertion form ran** (CS-018): `transactional`, or `window` with the connector's declared residual window. |
| `gates` | Each gate evaluated and its result (pass/fail/hold). |
| `decision` | `allow` \| `hold` \| `deny` \| `halt`, with the deciding rule/gate. |
| `approval` | Approver(s), quorum, outcome, timing — if applicable. |
| `outcome` | Connector result: `success` \| `failure` (+ reason) \| `not_executed`. |
| `resultRefs` | Stable downstream identifier(s) of the effect's result — the connector-returned id(s) of the created/changed record(s) (ledger entry, payment, message id, …). A **list**: one action may fan out to several records (a payment *and* its ledger entry), so it is the lineage/correlation key, not a single id. Populated for executed/settled effects; empty otherwise. The handle(s) an external system uses to locate, reconcile, or compensate the effect; the gateway records them but does **not** itself perform the reversal. |
| `correlationId` | Session/transaction id for replay. |

**Transactional audit (CS-006).** For an executed or settled `effect`, the audit record **MUST** be written in the **same transaction** as the state change it records (the outbox settle), so there can be neither an effect that occurred without a record nor a record of an effect that did not occur. Refusals and holds are recorded **before** the result is returned to the agent. Best-effort side-channel logging is **not** sufficient for the audit log.

**Remediation is downstream (boundary note).** The gateway's role in undoing a wrong-but-allowed effect is to make it *findable and actionable* — a complete, attributable record carrying `resultRefs` (CS-009) — **not** to perform the reversal. The compensating action is executed by the system of record, or as a gated operator action (§9), never reconstructed inside the gateway.

**Scope boundary — the gateway governs agent→world, not world→world.** The unit of enforcement is **one resolved action**; a compound/batch intent is decomposed into N actions, each independently authorized, audited, killed, and carrying its own `resultRefs` (bulk-as-one-effect is out of scope). The gateway records the *direct* effects of an agent action; it does **not** see or govern the **cascade** those effects trigger in downstream systems (a posted payment that fires a webhook → a journal entry → a covenant alert). Therefore an action's `reversibility`, `compensation`, `resultRefs`, and the kill guarantee all describe the **direct** effect only — never the world's reactions to it. Cascade reconciliation is the downstream systems' responsibility, joined back via `resultRefs`/`correlationId`; multi-step transactional consistency across several agent intents (sagas) is out of scope (the audit trail makes them reconstructable and externally unwindable, but ACP guarantees no atomicity across intents). Design analysis: `docs/03` → "Multi-effect & cascade".

---

## 12. Evaluation order (the pipeline)
For each attempted action the gateway MUST proceed strictly in this order, stopping at the first terminal verdict:

1. **Resolve** the action's kind, resource, name, and attributes from the registry. Unknown ⇒ DENY.
2. **Authorize** (§6.2): default deny → deny-wins → allow-match.
3. **Inject scope** (§6.3).
4. **Evaluate gates** (§7), cheapest/deterministic first; `requireApproval`/`dualAuthorization` last. Any `fail` ⇒ DENY; else any `hold` ⇒ HOLD (await approval, then re-enter at step 5 on grant).
5. **Check kill-switch** (§9). Active ⇒ HALT.
6. **Execute** via the connector as one transaction (effects staged per §4.4 durability rule).
7. **Record** the audit entry (§11) — for every outcome, including refusals.

On any dependency error, apply `failureMode` (§10).

**Decision freshness (CS-017).** This evaluation runs at **decision time**; for a staged effect (§4.4) the gateway MUST bound how stale that decision can get before dispatch, two ways:

1. **Decision TTL.** Every staged action carries an expiry, set at staging from gateway configuration (deployment config, **not** policy syntax — the language stays frozen). The default MUST be finite; for `irreversible` effects it SHOULD be short (minutes–hours, not days). A row claimed at or after its TTL settles `CANCELLED` with reason `stale-decision` (audited; the agent's ticket resolves to a recoverable refusal). An approval that arrives after expiry does not resurrect the row — the intent must be re-submitted and re-decided.
2. **Volatile-gate re-validation at dispatch.** Inside the dispatch claim — after the §9 kill re-check, before the connector call (order: **kill → TTL → volatile gates → connector**) — the gateway re-evaluates the action's **volatile** gates: `allowlist`/`denylist` (set membership changes), `window` (time has passed), `precondition`/`emissionControl` (world state changes), including registry-intrinsic preconditions. It MUST do so for `irreversible` effects and SHOULD for all staged effects. A dispatch-time failure settles `CANCELLED` with reason `stale-guard:<gate>` (audited), never a partial dispatch.

**Non-volatile gates are NOT re-run**, by definition: `valueLimit` and `contentCheck` judge the staged payload, which is frozen; the counters (`rate`/`quota`/`quantityCap`/`spendLimit`) were consumed at decision time — re-running them double-counts; and a `requireApproval`/`dualAuthorization` grant *is* the release — its freshness is bounded by the TTL (rule 1), not by re-asking. This is **not dispatch-time re-authorization**: `allow`/`deny` and scope *decisions* are not re-derived, approvals are not re-requested; the TTL bounds how stale any decision may get, and re-validation covers only the gate classes whose facts move independently of the agent. The kill switch remains the authoritative dispatch check (§9); CS-017's checks run inside the same claimed transaction, after it.

---

## 13. Validation rules (what the linter MUST check)
1. Every resource/action/scope/hook name referenced exists in the registry — **including names in `deny`** (CS-016). A deny of an undeclared name adds no protection (default-deny already refuses unknowns) and is almost always a typo that would otherwise silently arm itself as a no-op. To pre-forbid a capability, declare the action in the registry and deny it (the pattern the worked registries use for `prescribe`/`discontinue`).
2. No `allow` and `deny` that *only* a human could disambiguate — `deny` always wins, but overlapping intent SHOULD warn.
3. Every `transition` action referenced has declared `from` states.
4. Actions with `reversibility == irreversible` and no `requireApproval`/`dualAuthorization`/`precondition` ⇒ **warn**.
5. `failureMode: open` on an `irreversible` action ⇒ **error** unless explicitly acknowledged.
6. `'*'` grants ⇒ **warn** (encourage explicit enumeration).
7. `assess` actions with `explainability: required` but no `requireExplanation` gate ⇒ **error**.
8. Reads of `resultSensitivity > internal` with no `disclosure` gate ⇒ **warn**.
9. Condition expressions parse against the grammar (§8) and reference only known namespaces/functions.
10. A `compensable` action whose registry entry declares **no** `compensation` ⇒ **error** (the attribute value's definition, §5, is "a declared undo exists"); and any declared `compensation` that does **not** name a resource+action present in the registry ⇒ **error**. `irreversible` actions MAY declare a `compensation` but are not required to.
11. An action listed in both `deny` and a `standing` rule's `enables` ⇒ **error** — deny always wins (§6.2), so the standing grant is unsatisfiable (§7.15, CS-010).
12. A bare action name in `allow` that resolves to actions on more than one resource ⇒ **warn** — the grant applies everywhere the name is declared; use the `{ Entity: [names] }` map form to disambiguate (§6.1, CS-012).
13. `dualAuthorization` with an explicit `quorum` < 2 ⇒ **error** (contradicts the gate's definition, §7.9).

---

## 14. Worked examples (non-trivial, all kinds, multiple domains)

Each example exercises several kinds and gates. Together they cover all five kinds and the full gate catalog.

### 14.1 Customer support assistant (data / business)
*All reads scoped to the user's own customers; may email within corporate domains under rate, daily-quota, and DLP limits, with a session spend ceiling on all effects; may never refund or export; anything **high-impact** needs a supervisor (approval keys on stakes — `operativeForce` — not reversibility; see §5 note).*
```yaml
apiVersion: acp/v0.1
agent: support-assistant
defaults: { failureMode: closed, audit: full }
killable: true

allow:
  - observe:    [Customer, Order, Invoice]
  - record:     [Note]
  - effect:     [sendEmail]
  - transition: { Order: [confirm] }
deny:
  - effect:     [refund, exportData]
  - transition: { Order: [cancel] }

scope:
  Customer: assignedToCurrentUser
  Order:    customerAssignedToCurrentUser

gates:
  sendEmail:
    rate: 20/hour
    quota: 200/day
    allowlist:    { field: data.recipientDomain, set: corporate-domains }
    contentCheck: dlp.basic
  effect:
    spendLimit: 25/session          # cost ceiling on all effects; stops retry storms
  Order.confirm:
    precondition: { from: [pending_confirmation] }
  '*':
    requireApproval:
      when: "action.operativeForce == high"   # stakes, not reversibility (§5 note)
      approvers: role:support-supervisor
      timeout: 30m
      onTimeout: deny
```

### 14.2 Ward nurse assistant (healthcare — observe, assess, record, effect, transition)
*Reads scoped to the nurse's ward; sealed records need break-glass; triage is an explained, confirmed assessment; administration enforces five-rights and a per-patient dose cap and is irreversible; signing an order is a gated transition; prescribing is forbidden.*
```yaml
apiVersion: acp/v0.1
agent: ward-nurse-assistant
defaults: { failureMode: closed, audit: full }
killable: true

allow:
  - observe:    [Patient, Medication, Observation, Order]
  - assess:     [triage]
  - record:     [Observation]                      # e.g. vitals
  - effect:     [administer, pageOnCall]
  - transition: { Order: [sign], Encounter: [discharge] }
deny:
  - effect:     [prescribe, discontinue]
  - transition: { Medication: [prescribe] }

scope:
  Patient:     inWard(actor.ward)
  Observation: forPatientInWard(actor.ward)

gates:
  observe:
    disclosure:
      when: "action.resultSensitivity == restricted"     # e.g. psych/HIV records
      allowSink: [careTeam]
    requireApproval:
      when: "action.resultSensitivity == restricted and not exists context.breakGlass"
      approvers: role:charge-nurse
  triage:                                    # assess
    requireExplanation: true
    requireApproval: { when: "data.acuity <= 2", mode: confirm, approvers: role:clinician }
  administer:                                # effect, irreversible
    precondition: [fiveRightsVerified, notDiscontinued]
    quantityCap:  { per: resource.patientId, limit: 3, window: 24h, of: data.drug }
    requireApproval: { when: "action.operativeForce == high", approvers: role:clinician }
  Order.sign:                               # transition, operative
    precondition: { from: [draft] }
    requireApproval: { approvers: role:clinician }
```

### 14.3 Air/maritime track operator (defence — observe vs emitting effect, assess, transition, gated kinetic effect)
*Passive reads are clearance-scoped with disclosure control; an active radar sweep is an emitting `effect` needing deconfliction; combat-ID is an explained, dual-confirmed assessment; engagement is enabled only under a standing ROE state and requires positive ID, a collateral ceiling, and dual authorization — outside that state it falls to default-deny (deliberately **not** an explicit `deny`, which would beat the standing grant; §7.15, §13 rule 11).*
```yaml
apiVersion: acp/v0.1
agent: track-operator-assistant
defaults: { failureMode: closed, audit: full }
killable: true

allow:
  - observe:    [Track, IntelRecord]            # passive
  - assess:     [combatId, collateralEstimate]
  - record:     [TrackAnnotation]
  - effect:     [radarSweep]                     # emits
  - transition: { Track: [identify, designate] }
# 'engage' is deliberately absent from allow AND deny: default-deny covers the
# off state, and the 'weapons-free' standing rule below is its only way in.
# (An explicit deny would beat the standing grant — §7.15, §13 rule 11.)

standing:
  - name: weapons-free
    when: "context.roeState == 'weapons_free'"
    enables: { effect: [engage] }

scope:
  Track:       inCompartment(actor.clearance)
  IntelRecord: inCompartment(actor.clearance)

gates:
  observe:
    disclosure: { maxClassification: actor.clearance }
  radarSweep:                                   # emitting effect
    emissionControl: { checks: [emconAuthorized, deconflicted] }
  combatId:                                     # assess
    requireExplanation: true
    requireApproval: { mode: confirm, approvers: role:tactical-officer }
  Track.designate:
    precondition: { from: [identified] }
  engage:                                       # effect, irreversible, kinetic
    precondition:       [positiveIdentification]
    valueLimit:         { field: data.collateralEstimate, max: 1 }   # CDE threshold
    dualAuthorization:  { approvers: role:weapons-release-authority }
```

### 14.4 Payments operations agent (finance — tiered effects, dual-auth, sanctions, transition)
*Reads tenant-scoped; small payments auto-clear, mid-size need approval, large need dual authorization and a new-payee hold; sanctioned destinations are denied; export is forbidden.*
```yaml
apiVersion: acp/v0.1
agent: payments-ops-agent
defaults: { failureMode: closed, audit: full }
killable: true

allow:
  - observe:    [Account, Payment, Payee]
  - record:     [LedgerEntry]
  - effect:     [pay]
  - transition: { Invoice: [send, markPaid] }
deny:
  - effect:     [exportData]

scope:
  Account: tenantOf(actor)
  Payment: tenantOf(actor)

gates:
  pay:
    denylist:   { field: data.destinationCountry, set: sanctioned-list }
    valueLimit: { field: data.amount, max: 1000000, currency: USD }
    rate:       { limit: 50/hour, per: resource.payeeId }
    requireApproval:
      when: "data.amount > 1000 and data.amount <= 10000"
      approvers: role:payments-manager
    dualAuthorization:
      when: "data.amount > 10000"
      approvers: role:treasury
    precondition:
      when: "exists data.newPayee"
      checks: [payeeCoolingOffElapsed]      # new-payee hold
  Invoice.markPaid:
    precondition: { from: [sent] }
```

### 14.5 Legal matter assistant (data / business — ties to the repo demo)
*Reads scoped to the client; time entries and tasks are routine records; the `Engage` transition is legal only from `conflict_check` (the exact behaviour the repo already demonstrates); e-filing is allow-listed to approved courts, partner-approved, and confined to court hours; email is DLP-checked.*
```yaml
apiVersion: acp/v0.1
agent: legal-matter-assistant
defaults: { failureMode: closed, audit: full }
killable: true

allow:
  - observe:    [Matter, TimeEntry, Task, Staff]
  - record:     [TimeEntry, Task]
  - effect:     [sendEmail, eFile]
  - transition: { Matter: [engage, close] }
deny:
  - effect:     [deleteMatter]

scope:
  Matter:    clientOf(actor)
  TimeEntry: forMatterOfClient(actor)

gates:
  Matter.engage:
    precondition: { from: [conflict_check] }      # refuses from 'active', etc.
  eFile:
    allowlist:    { field: data.court, set: approved-court-systems }
    requireApproval: { approvers: role:supervising-partner }
    window:       { days: [Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri], hours: "08:00-17:00", tz: "America/New_York" }
  sendEmail:
    contentCheck: dlp.basic
    rate: 30/hour
```

### 14.6 Industrial vehicle controller (cyber-physical — bounded continuous effect)
*Setting target speed is inert; applying it is a safety-gated effect bounded by sensors and posted limits; the vehicle lifecycle is a transition; everything is killable.*
```yaml
apiVersion: acp/v0.1
agent: vehicle-controller
defaults: { failureMode: closed, audit: full }
killable: true

allow:
  - observe:    [Vehicle, Sensor]              # passive reads
  - record:     [Vehicle]                       # write target setpoint (inert)
  - effect:     [applySpeed]

## 15. Quick reference

**Kinds:** `observe` · `assess` · `record` · `effect` · `transition`
**Attributes:** `reversibility` · `emission` · `operativeForce` · `resultSensitivity` · `explainability`
**Gates:** `rate` · `quota` · `valueLimit` · `spendLimit` · `allowlist`/`denylist` · `precondition` · `contentCheck` · `requireApproval` · `dualAuthorization` · `window` · `quantityCap` · `disclosure` · `emissionControl` · `requireExplanation`
**Decisions:** `allow` · `hold` · `deny` · `halt`
**Top-level keys:** `apiVersion` · `agent` · `extends` · `defaults` · `allow` · `deny` · `scope` · `gates` · `standing` · `killable` · `audit`
**Precedence:** default deny → deny wins → most-specific allow → all matching gates AND → kill-switch → execute → record.
**Frozen:** the five kinds, the five attribute names, the fourteen gate types, and the condition operators/functions (unchanged since v0.1; v0.3's only grammar change, CS-013, widens the right side of `in` to accept a function — no new operator or function). Growth is by adding resources, actions, scope predicates, named sets, and hooks — never new language constructs.
